Lecture Title: Introduction to Photosynthesis

Today we discussed the process by which plants convert sunlight into energy, known as photosynthesis. This primarily occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells.

Key terms:
- Chlorophyll: the green pigment that absorbs light
- Stomata: small pores on leaves that allow gas exchange
- Glucose: sugar produced as a result of the process

The overall chemical equation is:
6CO2 + 6H2O + sunlight â†’ C6H12O6 + 6O2

This means carbon dioxide and water, in the presence of sunlight, are converted into glucose and oxygen.

Two main stages:
1. Light-dependent reactions: occur in the thylakoid membranes; convert light energy into chemical energy (ATP and NADPH)
2. Light-independent reactions (Calvin Cycle): occur in the stroma; use ATP and NADPH to fix CO2 and produce glucose

Importance:
- Provides the base of the food chain
- Removes CO2 from the atmosphere
- Produces oxygen we breathe

Professor ended by mentioning how photosynthesis efficiency can vary depending on environmental factors like temperature, light intensity, and CO2 concentration.
